# ToDoApp (Java)

I created this simple app to apply my learning of arrays, loops, and user input in Java.

## 📝 What it Does

- Takes up to 5 tasks from the user.
- Stores them temporarily in an array.
- Displays all the entered tasks back to the user.

It’s a basic console-based program to understand how input/output and arrays work in Java.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to take input using `Scanner`.
- How to store items in an array.
- Using `for` loops to repeat actions.
- Displaying data using basic `System.out.println()`.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ).
3. Run the `ToDoApp.java` file.
4. Enter your tasks when prompted.
